Instruction:
I am trying to build an integration between APIs. Your job is to:
1. from a list of APIs below, select which APIs would be relevant to the user's task
2. call the provided function to get relevant API endpoints for the selected APIs in order to build the integration.

You can select 2 or more APIs, depending on the user's needs.

User's task: {user_query}

APIs to choose from:
{api_summaries}

Python function to get relevant API endpoints:
search_api_endpoints(query: str, api_names: list[str], limit: int = 5): Searches for API endpoints and their information for a query. If api_names are provided, only searches for endpoints in those APIs. You can specify a limit on the number of results returned.

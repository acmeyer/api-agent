Instruction: 
The following are summaries for different endpoints in a product's OpenAPI spec. Your job is to take these summaries and write an overall summary for the entire API. It should include:
- How the API works
- What you can do with the API
- All available endpoint routes and operations as a bullet point list
- Any other important information you think is relevant for a developer using the API to know

You should be as detailed as possible but try to keep the summary to less than 600 words.
